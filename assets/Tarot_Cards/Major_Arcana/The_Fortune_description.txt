## **I. Background of Fortune Thoth Tarot card**

### **1\. The Fortune Thoth Tarot**

The picture depicts a wheel (vertical) in front of a background which is full of lightning and swirling energy. Those lightning strikes correspond to Zeus, the God that Crowley equates with Jupiter in the Fortune Thoth Tarot card: they emanate from the oval (horizontally or divine wheel) on the side of the card. Those vortices of energy are generated from its continuous rotation. In the vertical wheel, we can see images such as Hermanubis, the monkey creature that is constructive and mindful; Typhon, the crocodile that is destructive and reminiscent of the past; and at the highest point, is the Sphinx that is connected and is keeping the extremes balanced.

They all represent three forms of energy that govern the movement of events. They are the best known in the form of three Indian gods: Brahma, the creator (Hermanubis); Vishnu, the conservator (Sphinx); and Shiva, the God of destruction (Typhon). This trio keeps the wheel turning up and down and making it clear that heaven and hell not only fight with but also complement each other. Darkness is not the opposite of light (through darkness, light can be avoided), perhaps, it is rather an aspect of light: evil is not a destructive thing but rather a disturbance to the balance of the universe, and goodness sometimes causes this, and goodness is not simply that which brings vitality to creation, but what keeps the creative order balanced, and this also includes destruction.

### **2\. Relationship (Fool and Magus)**

Hermanubis, the monkey-headed creature, Typhon, the crocodile-headed God of destruction and instinctive management, we encountered them on card number 1 and 0, all drawn in the Fortune Thoth Tarot. They all together form 10. The number 0 is the original energy while the number 1 is the action, and the number 10 is the reality or the result of the action, trying to return to the original energy so that it can return to itself again: number 0 is the sea, number 1 is the wave, and number 10 is the rule of pulling the wave back to the sea and producing a new wave.

## **II. Analyze and describe Fortune Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Motif (three forms of energy)**

#### **a. The Wheel**

Birth and death are not related to each other as two sides of the coin. Instead, they are on the same side but separated by time or wheel because the wheel is the fundamental symbol of the intactness, it moves continuously but its mind remains unchanged. Everything that emerges, develops and then disappears no longer exists because the turning circle of the wheel of life brings everything to the dance of fortune.

If you look in another direction, nothing is formed or disappears because the wheel shaft is always there and fixed at the center. It is the wheel of the sky that has constantly revolved around the ground for millions of years. The power behind the wheel is the Eternal to make the wheel move; spokes are spiritual patterns that connect eternity with elements of time and space; symbols on the wheel contour (Sphinx, Hermanubis, and Typhon) are catalysts that transform the subconscious pattern of eternity into personal fate; and the way the wheel is rolling represents the impact of our actions.

#### **b. Typhon**

In the Fortune Thoth Tarot, we can see that Typhon (Tarnas) lies on the right and let himself drop down, giving its first dynamic wheel. However, it will not fall because it will always turn back on the wheel with both its legs and its solid tail (the tail is wrapped in the wheel forming an infinite loop). Typhon is the son of Gaia Mother Earth and Tartaros: Typhon himself is the father of the three-headed Hell Hound. With the goal of destroying creativity, he fought the Olympus gods but was eventually killed by the lightning of Zeus and buried beneath the rock that is now called Sicily. Every time Etna struggles, we will hear his voice echo from hell.

In Egyptian mythology, Typhon corresponds to Seth, the embodiment of the desert sun burning everything. He is seen as the God of destruction, the destroyer and the enemy of his older brother Osiris, corresponding to the dampness – the element that brings life and is loved by everyone. The Egyptians considered Nile river “the symbol of Osiris’s penis”, each year it rises and flows through the arid black lands, corresponding to his body. As long as the fertile flow of the Nile has not yet appeared, it is clear that the dry power of Seth will be dominant. On the Fortune Thoth Tarot, we can see him holding the symbol of life – the Key Cross – on his right hand and the Heka staff – the sign of Osiris and the symbol of his magical power – on his left hand.

#### **c. (Herm) Anubis**

This fall to hell is the complete opposite of Hermanubis (Rajas). Anubis represents the power of recovery that, according to Egyptian mythology, collected the body parts of Osiris (he was cut down by Seth/Typhon into 22 pieces). Crowley calls this character Hermanubis, referring to the name of the Egyptian God, Heru-em-Apun – who is the unity of the heaven God Horus and the hell god Anubis and governs both the upper and lower worlds in the new shape. Hermanubis was later regarded as the connection and the format of the guide of the Egyptian soul, Anubis, and the guide of the Greek soul, Hermes. This combined form emphasizes good moral aspects and eliminates the doubts that the Greeks often attribute to Hermes.

#### **d. The Sphinx**

At the highest point of the wheel, the Sphinx with the Nemes headscarf of the kings and the snake Uraeus on the forehead symbolizes the unifying power of the four elements that govern the wheel. At the Sphinx, people will face unbelievable things behind the wheel, evoking in them the question of the origin of all things. Humanity will represent this search because there is no concept that can provide evidence for the actual part without reflecting on human desire. However, people only accept what they can control, and exactly, the Sphinx will destroy our illusions of controlling everything; we must understand that Sphinx is one the challenge for us to be humble and avoid the fate of Oedipus, who has become a victim of his own wisdom

### **2\. Space and Time (wheel of fortune)**

#### **a. Two wheels**

An ancient Chinese divination method is to turn two wheels (or Mandala) together. One wheel will be fixed and reflect the eternity, the old heavenly order, and Ho-ton while the other wheel will rotate above symbolizing a mirror of the period of re-circulation, the new heavenly order, and Lo Shon. The combination of the two wheels will make predictions. This concept also created the basis for the I Ching, with 64 variables combined in two Baguas, corresponding to upper and lower.

#### **b. Wheel of earthly**

The earthly wheel (vertical) in the middle of Fortune Thoth Tarot symbolizes the circulating world of endless development and decline, as opposed to the image of the Western tradition of the world, recognizing only one start (moment of creation) and an end (end of the world). The concept of death and rebirth is linked to a periodic painting that dominates matriarchal cultures and is still prevalent in Asia today. However, this is not a comforting factor because it is newly reviewed in our culture – “there is nothing that is not changing, nothing that is not moving, nothing that is not transforming, nothing that is not becoming something else.”

#### **c. Wheel of heaven**

The wheel of heaven (horizontal) is the wheel of the sky that has constantly revolved around the ground for millions of years. It is the wheel of the universe, the wheel of destiny, and the wheel of karma. It represents the eternal cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. The Fortune Thoth Tarot reminds us that everything in life is constantly changing, and that we must learn to adapt to these changes if we want to achieve our goals. It also reminds us that we are all part of a larger cosmic dance, and that our individual destinies are intertwined with the destiny of the universe.
