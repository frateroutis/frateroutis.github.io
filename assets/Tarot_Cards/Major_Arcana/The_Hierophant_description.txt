## **I. Background of the Hierophant Thoth Tarot**

There are many triangles that are intertwined in the middle of the Hierophant Thoth Tarot, we can call them the aggregated cells, creating a maze of space and time on the surface of the card. Crowley called it the beginning of a newly born Chronicle: the god Horus (see the [**card XX**]()). The complex morphological forms surrounding Hierophant are pentagonal and pentagrams, symbolizing the essence and the discovery of meaning. As part of differences dimension and time, the flame of desire in the pattern of suppressed consciousness, or in a state where emotions cannot be touched, the shadow Goddess stands at the foot. Immersed into the light at a brighter angle of the card, she is the Great Mother, who never abandons her child. Crowley himself linked Hierophant with brutal qualities and copied the Devil’s image, who had defiled the image of the Father.

Immersed into the light at a brighter angle of the card, she is the Great Mother, who never abandons her child. Crowley himself linked Hierophant with brutal qualities and copied the Devil’s image, who had defiled the image of the Father.

There is a panorama of the pattern around the priest character (the cow, the elephant, and the symbol of the four miniatures). In the ” salvation serpent” (kundalini), closed with nine nails around the head like a holy ring, we can see the mind and spirit which is rolling around his head with pleasure feelings but also shows the high heaven and the presence of the gods at the tip of the dove. Crowley writes: The symbolic image of the snake and the dove refers to this verse in the “Book of the Law” – chapter 1, verse 57: “Where there are love and passion. There are doves and snakes. ”

## **II. Analyze And Describe The Hierophant Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. The shape (The Metropolitan)**

#### **a. The Hierophant Thoth Tarot (pentagram)**

The Hierophant Thoth Tarot represents the world of faith and a deep belief in life comes from the certainty faith. To find the hidden meanings is his deep motivation, the strong belief in being a part of the higher level was developed from his knowledge. This is reflected in the upward five-pointed star, the symbol of humanity. He hid the Pentagon in which another five-pointed star was inside. This image can expand or shrink forever without losing its structure or balance. Thus, it is a symbol of the law of correlation “macro = micro”, and symbolizes the harmonious integration of people in the universe.

The largest Pentagon is filled by Hierophant, he understands the fifth element through the largest possible prism.

#### **b. The priest’s stick (three epochs)**

The three circles at the tail of the stick, which is the key-shaped, is the combination of the past, present, and future harmoniously. The Hierophant Thoth Tarot shows the representative of the three corresponding eras respectively, Crowley wrote:

The small form of the green goddess representing the era of Isis for a long time, Hierophant embodies the Osiris era which is including the past 2000 years and ending hours, and the child Horus in the middle shows the age The original Horus, is about to be born. The essential for innovation is reflected in Hierophant’s face but it is empty and lifeless, and the four little angels flying around him. They represent the old beliefs that have condensed into the lack of vitality in his own faith since the power of the new in the child is reflected in the hidden pentagram.

#### **c. The Devil Horn (evil submitters)**

The sealed part of the doctrine is shown in the priest’s left hand, he threatens those who do not deserve the two extended fingers that form the devil’s horns. Through that action, he protected them from exposure when they were not strong enough to receive. This is the reason why we can also recognize the “advocatus diaboli” (the evil submitters) in Hierophant, misleading those who seek knowledge and perceptions through intellectual symbols and characters. When religious and mythical knowledge and symbols are analyzed wisely based on the method “this is nothing more than …”, life will escape from them and they will become barren like the temple was broken and put into the museum.

### **2\. The aura on the head (human depravity)**

#### a. **Serpent**

The windows, the serpent and the dove around Hierophant’s head allude to the story of the Fall of Man on his way. The role of the snake is known after Adam blamed Eve, she dumped it on the snake, who still carries it with her so far. It was then that we were informed, from the years of wandering the desert, that the snake not only had the power of killing but also could save people – although looking at it, we saw the image of the sinner. It is just as the impudent snake was hung by Moses on the cross, the snake was hung on nine Hierophant’s nails (which is the number of the moon representing wisdom, the main element of the feminine).

#### **b. Doves**

The dove is known as the symbol of the Divine Soul, so we easily forget that it also carries the female gender in Hebrew. It is the power that goes through the water and contains the feminine potential of creation within it. In neighboring religions, doves are symbols of Aruru, Ishtar, Astarte, Aphrodite, or any supreme Goddess identified with Venus, and those who resemble Eve, bearing the title “mother of lives”. Her Roman name is Juno, meaning dove. She was portrayed as a dove with a branch in the beak. It is symbolized her newborn and a promised child, who would free mankind from sin.

### **3\. The window (interwoven pentagons)**

#### **a. The Pentangle (the entire cross-section)**

With the snake and the dove, Eve has two people involved in the Fall of Human. We will meet them again in the [**XVI card – Tower**](). The forbidden fruit itself (traditionally an apple) is hidden behind the window. Apple fruit is a symbol of Venus. If you cut the apple horizontally, the apple core will form a five-pointed star, also a symbol of Venus. Every eight years, Venus will transport between the Earth and the Sun for five times. These five points are identified as a pentagram, drawn by Venus on the zodiac.

The two halves of the apple were drawn on the window to reflect the two sides of Venus: known as Hesperus and phosphorus, grow and dive, the joy and affliction of Venus, the charming woman and “Belle Dame sans Merci” (cruel beauty). According to Robert Graves, a famous mythologist, the apple is a gift (in the matriarchy era) that the nun and ruler of the apple forest (Avalon), used to tempt the king to catastrophic death at the end of his reign by love songs.

The apple is the symbol of death (at least half the apple that Snow White had eaten), but it is also the statue of immortality and eternity because of its round shape. With the same sign, it is also a powerful feminine symbol to create life, but in the end, it regains that life (Mother Earth). These two extremes are reflected in Eve: with her dark side (snake), she is the one who brings death to humanity; with her bright face (dove), she brings the savior to the world. As biting the apple, mankind knows the difference between good and evil. Accurately, the Hierophant Thoth Tarot is a symbol of the spiritual journey and the search for truth. It represents the connection between the human and the divine, and the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

### **4\. The four miniatures**

At the four corners of the card, there are four miniatures that represent the four elements: fire, water, air, and earth. These miniatures are also associated with the four evangelists: Matthew (man), Mark (lion), Luke (ox), and John (eagle). They symbolize the four aspects of the human being: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. The Hierophant Thoth Tarot reminds us that we are all connected to these elements and that we should strive for balance in all aspects of our lives.
