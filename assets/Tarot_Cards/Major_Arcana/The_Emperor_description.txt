## **I. Background of the Emperor Thoth Tarot card**

### **1\. The card**

The Emperor Thoth Tarot card shows a majestic and mature character who dressed in stately costume and fitted with two giant male sheep heads that symbolize the two pillars or the back of the crystal throne. At the same time, he was illuminated by an invisible light source. His head turned to the right. The crimson cloak was embroidered with two gold symbols, and his head wore a powerful crown.

His right hand held a scepter shaped like a lamb’s head, and his left hand held a sphere attached to a Maltese cross. His arms and head (from elbow to hairline) form an equilateral triangle, and his legs cross into a right-angled T-shape. So, his sitting posture corresponds to the symbol of sulfur, in alchemy, it represents strong masculine energy. A lamb and two eagles of the [**Empress Thoth Tarot**]() are located at his feet.

### **2\. The connection (the Empress)**

The relationship between the Emperor and the [Empress]() is remarkable, not only because these two cards are next to each other and face each other, but also they follow a similar motif, and they complement each other in terms of form and color. While the Empress embodies a flow of blue-colored limbs with a soft light that represents a variety of births, the Emperor has a solid and clear structure with the dark red indicating the will to grow and arrange what feminine energies have brought.

## **II. Analyze and describe the Emperor Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Shape (Patriarch)**

#### **a. Emperor**

The majestic and masculine image of the Emperor Thoth Tarot shows his direct and active behavior with a constant expansion to new areas of rule. The deepest nature of him is expressed by a tight and balanced order. This corresponds to the ability of self-control or self-development (the outward direction), whereby all unimpeded life flows will be oriented in a fixed direction. The process of comprehension and real planning is attracted to this place.

#### **b. The glance (the sheep)**

Just like the horizontal view of the Empress, expressing the subconscious awkwardness of being unable to format the intrinsic instincts; the horizontal head shows the will of the ego which wants to hold the point of view based on reason about the world, for fear that if not so, it will not be proportional to the external situation. Just as Empress’s gaze was directed to the pigeon (inherited from the Priestess), the Emperor’s sheep merged with [**Magus’s magic**]() (a Mercury/Aries symbol), and it originated from the intention to assert itself in this world.

#### **c. The hands (scepter and sphere)**

The symbol of his power is the scepter and the sphere (ruling the world). While the Empress carries the sign of willingness to open and wholeheartedly (she holds a lotus flower in her hand), the sheep-headed scepter embodies the desire to assert itself and the effort to conquer a supreme realm of a person in the infinite range of eternity, creating a solid structure of a person within that realm. The sphere represents strength or the control of the ego which is striving for safety and serenity.

#### **d. The costume (yellow bees)**

However, the main goal of the Emperor Thoth Tarot is not to conquer everything around him but the rules and structures of the things he has experienced. Bees – symbolize the proliferation or the role of the mother on the Empress’s coat – represent the structure of the beehive, and therefore also represent the father’s role and rule over the Emperor’s coat. It also includes the fusion of instincts and emotions in the external form, which will lead these forces into the path of justice and order.

#### **e. Expressive image (crown)**

The Emperor’s strong, firm expression and the well-proportioned structure of the card shows that an extremely consistent inner position can and will satisfy the requirements of life. The majestic crown attached with precious stones shows a cross inside a circle, corresponding to the creation (+) of eternity (O).

### **2\. Background (Elements)**

#### **a. Throne**

The ruler, whose hand holding the scepter and the sphere, sat on the crystal throne and is the embodiment of a condensed and realistic truth. He focused on structures and inspections objectively and seriously in every struggle ideology as well as their applicability. This is in contrast to Empress’s soft curves and light blue tones, this card describes a rigid, burning and purposeful energy source.

#### **b. The head of the male sheep**

The two pillars in the back take the shape of two giant male heads. Sheep are a symbol of inner strength that helps us pursue specific goals. At a higher level, it embodies the internal connection with the creative power of the fatherly spirit. At a deeper level, it represents taking control of a will to destroy the determination of the ego.

#### **c. Light (coming from the top edge of the card)**

The rays illuminating the Emperor Thoth Tarot from above are the symbol of the ego. Experiencing one’s ego also means to experience the feeling of being touched by the divine. This portrait depicts the ancient source of knowledge about the polarity of all things, and here, it indicates that the ruler is represented by both his bright and dark sides.

#### **d. Bright and dark side (two sheep heads)**

In two sheep heads, one stands in the dark and one is outside. With the ruler in the central position, they form a motif that has been passed down to us since ancient times: the Moon Goddess (Selene) sits between her bright side (Artemis) and her dark side (Hekate); Jesus on the cross between two thieves, only one of them followed him to heaven that day; or Dadophoren, the torchbearer on the side of Mithras, which depicts Cautes with a torch of life directing toward the sky and Cautapates with a torch of death facing the ground.

We also find similar motifs in the Empress, she sits on the throne between the full moon and the crescent. In all these cases, the higher rule is closely portrayed with opposing poles between light and darkness, life and death, creating and destroying within it.

### **3\. Foreground (Spiral shape)**

#### **a. Two-headed eagle**

The eagle we encountered in the Empress card as “a symbol of essence through eternal correspondence” (the white eagle in the moon’s symbol), is once again described as “an eternal existence through unending needs” (the red eagle in the symbol of the sun), then it will bring the structure of eternity through the power of consciousness. The difference when compared to the eagle of Empress is quite obvious: while the Empress’s eagle stands on the left and corresponds to the moon, it expresses the internal resources of femininity (instinctive openness and willingness to show devotion), the Emperor’s eagle stands to the right and shows conscious rule to materialize.

The crimson disc-shaped object represents the redness of the alchemists, corresponding to the nature of the sun, and thus, it emphasizes the rule of matter through the enlightening power of consciousness. And so in the two-headed eagle on the Empress and the Emperor Thoth Tarot, there were two primitives, “white” and “red” alchemists, first appearing. They will appear more often in the **[Major Arcana Thoth Tarot]()**.

### **4\. The ram**

In the Emperor Thoth Tarot, the ram is a symbol of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, which represents new beginnings, leadership, and courage. The ram is also associated with the god Amon-Ra, who was often depicted with a ram’s head. The ram’s horns symbolize strength, power, and authority. The ram is a powerful symbol of masculine energy and the will to create and dominate.
