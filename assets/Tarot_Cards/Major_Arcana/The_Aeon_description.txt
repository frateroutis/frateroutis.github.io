## **I. Background of the Aeon Thoth Tarot card**

### **1\. The Aeon Thoth Tarot card**

The Nut Goddess that Crowley called “the symbol of endless possibilities”, contrary to the charming form of “fairy star”, is not expressed in human form, “but part of the sky”. The Goddess of the sky showed herself like a green frame shining in space, an upside-down egg of light. This typical essence corresponds to her code and also means a uterus or vase. According to Crowley, the upside-down and winged egg symbolizes Nut’s lover, the man he calls Hadit.

From the usual legend, Crowley thinks that the child Harpokrates (childish Horus) in the foreground is the connection of Nut and Hadit. However, this child is not only the embodiment of the connection between the concept (Hadit) and the ability (Nut) but also the vertical cut through time (connecting the past and the future). This is seen in the Haroeris character in the center (adult Horis) in the background, the person who reaches out of the past to enter the uncertain present and can become the future. Dual Horus, on a deeper level, symbolizes the beginning that created itself from the end and is the symbol of the end that has emerged from the beginning: the nature of time.

### **2\. Aeon (new era)**

Nut, Hadit and Hoor-pa-kraat (= Hapokrates = the child Horus) are three Gods who have read to Crowley the “Book of the Law” through Aiwass, extraterrestrial intelligence. He accepted it at noon from April 8 to April 10, 1904, in Cairo and declared the beginning of a new era: Horus’s era will now replace the era of the dying God (Osiris). The Aion of Persia that Aeon, the name of this card, based on his name, is an icon of the time of the world as the earliest appearance, but also signifies the age as well as the eternity. The great day is celebrated every year on the 6th of January in the temple of Kore in Alexandria because Kore gave birth to Aion, the God of eternity, on this day. Heraclitus talks about him: “He is a child, playing like a child assembling pieces together. The rule belongs to a child. ”

## **II. Analyze and describe the Aeon Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Motif (heavenly eggs)**

#### **a. Nut, Hadit, Hoor-pa-kraat, and Ra-hoor-khuit**

Completely keeping Egyptian legends, Crowley blends mythological characters that are inherently separate. Horus (Appolo in Greece) was originally the son of the Goddess of the sky (Greece – Rhea) with her husband, the god Geh (Greek – Cronos) was born. At the same time, Nut gave birth to five children, Horus was the brother of Isis, Osiris, Seth (Greek – Typhon) and Nephthys. Thus, he is considered a falcon and the God of the world, light, and sky. His Egyptian name was Heru which became Harachte (“Horus from the horizon”) and described him as a God of the rising morning sun. He was then inputted into the God of Sun, Re, as a character and named Re Haracte that Crowley transliterated into Ra-hoorit.

On the other hand, Osiris mythology tells that Horus was the son that Isis conceived from the dying God Osiris (some sources still claim to be dead). His name is Hoor-pa-kraat (Greek-Harpokrates) meaning “Horus child”. He was portrayed as a sun child, sitting on a lotus blooming and sucking his thumb. However, as in the Aeon Thoth card, it is common to see him standing with his index finger in his mouth. Because Egyptian mythology later described that Nut, the Goddess of the sky, gradually grew to become a great Goddess with the sacred cow Hathor and the goddess Isis, Crowley merged those myths by calling Nut/Isis the mother who brought Horus to this world. He then appeared as “the childish Horus” and “adult Horus”.

There is only one problem that needs to be clarified which is the child’s father. Those who are considered: Osiris, Haporkrates’s dying father, Geb, Nut’s husband, or Re, the Sun God and Nut’s lover, who, according to Plutarch, is the father of two of the five children, Osiris and Horus. Most likely, Geb, his Egyptian name is sometimes written with the “egg” symbol and some people consider he was the first God to lay down the world egg, corresponding to his portrait, is an egg in the Aeon Thoth card.

The winged sun on the top of the egg turned upside down defending the Sun God Re who Crowley called Hadit’s father and said he was Nut’s lover. However, we are not familiar with this name. Hadit means light in ancient Egyptian, and in language related to Hai, a term that refers to the sun God with “the brilliant”: “Hadit” is the name that the Arab alchemists place for iron elements, and in turn, it corresponds to Seth. Perhaps, it was Crowley’s allusion, making Seth – the “antagonistic” character becomes Nut’s lover, reinforced by the portrait of the common child as a snake in Atu XXI.

#### **b. Nut/Isis**

Nut, who is seen on par with Hathor and Isis, embodies the sky. She was a sacred cow leaning towards her husband, the God of Geb, during the day and going down at night to reunite with him. It was her who gave birth to the Gods, and the Egyptians talked about how she had swallowed the sun every night in the west and gave birth to him again from her body every morning. Her blood fell in the process of coloring the morning sky with the red sun rising. She is a great mother who gives life and then retracts it into her body. The coffin and tombstone are also called Nut because the dead are again in Nut’s body. We see her as the blue character in the Aeon Thoth card, bending like a bell when it wraps around the golden egg. She was the ruler that brought time and then regained it.

#### **c. Hadit**

The Egyptians considered the golden egg as the fruit of Isis (Nut). In this card, it is the egg of light or fireball lying on the safety of the Goddess of the sky. This shining ball, filling the whole sky, is also the universe, Hadit. Crowley said that he was a popular view all over the world and was the concept of the only Realism that is philosophically stable, here, was equivalent to the stand in the truest meaning of the word.

### **2\. Horus (dual character)**

Horus, the ruler of the new era, who reflected both sides of man in his double image, was born of the unity of the contrary, the fiery masculine power of Hadit with Nut’s blue water. Physically, he was Re-Harachte and was found in the light egg of Hadit, mentally, he was the young and pure power of Harpokrates, who demanded silence.

#### **a. Adult Horus (Ra-hoor-khuit/Re-Harachte)**

On the inner side (solar network) we see Ra-hoor-khuit as a symbol of tough power. The Pharaohs themselves claimed to be the Eagle God and was worshiped as his being. He carried a plate of the sun on his head and told himself, according to Crowley: “I am the Lord of the dual chopsticks of power; Coph Nia’s power chopsticks; but my left hand is empty because I have crushed a universe, and nothing else.

#### **b. Childish Horus (Hoor-pa-kraat/Harpokrates)**

Harpokrates is the child that Isis conceives from a dying God, some legends have said that he died – Osiris. He was considered sick, and his life was occasionally threatened. As a valid successor to the throne, the son had a difficult and tiring struggle with his uncle Seth (cruel), who also claimed succession. In the end, his mother, Isis, had to make a trick to have a decisive breakthrough and secure his throne. Harpokrates are often drawn like ...7899 bytes truncated...
