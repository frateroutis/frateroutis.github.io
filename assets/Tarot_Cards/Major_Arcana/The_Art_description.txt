## **I. Background of the Thoth Art Tarot card**

Alchemists call their profession “art” (the art of perfection or philosophical art), its main task is to combine contradictory elements on a higher level so that it can transform the basic into a higher one. Among the four elements (Fire, Air, Earth, and Water), Fire and Water are the most extreme pairs of discrepancies, so their unification represents the highest art. This connection, shown on the Fool Thoth Tarot card on his head, now moves to the center of the drawing. The mixture of Fire and Water, however, is not only in appearance but also an internal process.

The connection between the Emperor and the Empress, which is still self-reflection (because they do not look at each other but only look at themselves in the painting) that can now be completed. The Thoth Art Tarot card represents the completion of a marriage represented by the Lovers card. These two representatives now form a bisexual character, originating from the Greek God, Artemis (God with many breasts). Even the bees and snakes on her dress are also united. The lion and eagle also grow in size and exchange each other’s colors.

Based on our own stages of transformation, we know that such changes occur not without pain. Everything of the darkness and thoughts surrounding the self will have to die before an individual is born again as Phoenix reborn from ashes. This is also manifested by the influx of steam from the boiling kettle as they rise in rainbow colors and flow around the shoulders of this bisexual dual character.

An arrow shot up and pinned into the center of the light. The outfit of the character is green – the color of nature. Behind it, there is a giant sun shining with the words:: VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTFICANDO INVENFIES OCCULTUM LAPIDEM (please visit the inner part of the earth; by refining, you will find the hidden stone). Alchemists created the word “Chyma” based on the word “Kemet” of the Egyptian word, meaning black, and as “primitive matter”, it is considered to be on par with the Nile’s mud, the top black soil of life or the body of Isis.

## **II. Analyze and describe the Thoth Art Tarot**

### **1\. Subject (contradictory elements)**

#### **a. Humanoid (dual)**

This bisexual figure symbolizes the completion of the Chymical marriage of the Lovers. Just as the couple was drawn separately in this Thoth Art Tarot card, the black king with a golden crown and a red lion, a white queen with a silver crown and a white eagle – they were now unified.

According to the exchange principle, the queen now has a black head, and the king has a white head; and through tight twisting (the swap is inserted into the balance), the white face of the right part focuses on the white arm’s activity on the left while the black face on the left towards the black arm on the right held a lantern that turned into a torch. The fire turned water into steam, and the water put out the fire.

#### **b. The white lion and red eagle**

In the tradition of alchemy, sulfur and mercury are the two basic ingredients – which can be merged together appropriately – turned into gold, and it symbolically corresponds to the opposing pair of king – queen, red-white, sun-moon, fire-water, men-woman, fixed-changeable, dry-wet, etc. At least it is an aspect – an obvious one. However, there is also wisdom in which two streams of light need to be handed over before the great work (large artwork) is merged.

On the cognitive level, this task is precisely reversed. From this perspective, white corresponds to male semen, and red is women’s blood. On the other hand, position change means that rigid insistence based on a one-way perspective will not lead to desired results. On a deeper level, it is assumed that each side contains an attribute of the opposite polarity that needs to be included in the transformation process.

This understanding is probably reflected in German, one of the few languages that recognize femininity in the sun and masculinity in the moon. So, the Thoth Art Tarot card shows us that the eagle and lion have colors that are the opposite of their colors in card number VI, the Lovers.

#### **c. Ability to change**

Love longs for unity, and as such it demonstrates the alchemy process on the emotional level. According to ancient magic traditions, a lover created the inner image of him/her according to the image of the other person. This means that the average emotion in women becomes more masculine, and in men, it becomes more feminine, shown by C.G. Jung in the term animus/anima (the male part of the female/feminine part of the male), which he called the corresponding subconscious of the opposite sex in humans.

### **2\. The transferability**

#### **a. The alchemy process**

The goal of alchemists is to refine the material and turn it into a more advanced form by burning it. The two basic elements for this purpose are mercury and sulfur, whereby the mercury typically represents a quality that can melt (water) and sulfur as a flammable quality (fire). Depending on the proportions of the ingredients, all seven metals are made up of the two main ingredients. However, if someone follows the instructions for mixing mercury and sulfur literally, the results will only be mercury sulfur (poor quality)!

#### **b. Kettle (skull)**

**Crowley writes:**

The ritual of this great work is in a mixture of opposite elements in the cauldron used for cooking. This is expressed as gold or the sun because the Sun is the Father of all Life and (especially) controlling the distillation. The fertility of the soil is maintained by rain and the sun. Rain is formed from a slow, gentle and effective process by evaporation of Air, which is the result of the alchemy of marriage between Fire and Water. Thus, the formula of life is also death or decay. Here, it is symbolized by Caput Mortuum (dead head) on a cauldron and a crow perched on the skull.

#### **c. Ash (salt)**

For the first time in the Middle Ages (around the 16th century), alchemy renounced dualism and developed the Tripitaka, adding salt as a third element. It corresponds to the remaining ash after the sulfur has burned and the mercury has evaporated in the smoke. These three elements are called philosophical elements to distinguish them from the four classical elements. For the three philosophical elements corresponding to the four classical elements (sulfur = fire, salt = Earth, and evaporation mercury such as Water and Air), the description of the situation is both a triangle and a square, quite confusing, so it means that anything that is expressed in this way can be found in the three philosophical elements as well as four classic elements.

#### **d. Light lines, arrows**

Steam is formed through the bond of Water and Fire, embodying the sparkling soul during the alchemy. The soul flew away from the kettle like a stream of light and flowed into a rainbow-colored flower around the character’s shoulders. That light softens the old problems because, as the body is reflected in the mind and the soul, the soul and mind are also reflected in the body.

By applying alchemy to our own bodies and souls, we can proceed through the scum of stored behavior patterns, and discover areas of repression of illness and resignation, whose mind becomes blind. The arrow is shooting upward from the middle of the stream of light (the symbol of Mercury), emp...8497 bytes truncated...
