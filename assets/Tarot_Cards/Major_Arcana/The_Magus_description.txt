## **II. Analyze and describe the Magus Thoth Tarot**

### **Topic about the Magus Thoth (Magus Mercurius)**

#### **1\. The Magus Thoth Tarot**

[**The Fool Thoth**](), embodied the seed of appearing, it is still floating somewhere in the clouds, The Magus represents something that has formed, or psychologically, is an ego. That is why Crystal here is self-pleased as a small god, understanding the origin of creation, and stirring up the surrounding spheres with a radiant and mischievous face. According to the elegant gesture, he conjures images of his strange world, in which the energies coalesce into objects and the eternal manifests itself in time and space.

#### **2\. Posture/Balance**

If the Fool is suspended in nothingness, the Magus Thoth Tarot deftly balances at the top of the subconscious, he is forming his own will. His posture was like a stork standing motionless on one leg and thus it became the symbol of the highest concentration and the symbolic animal of Thoth, the Egyptian God of Wisdom.

The Greeks called him Hermes and portrayed him with winged shoes, as we see here with the Magus image; They symbolize the first step of the ego to bring the soul which has been woven according to karma, from the deep bottom of eternity into the new cycle on earth with the end of hope for eternal atonement. The subconscious that he is standing on is the equivalent of the upper part. It can be seen through the blue-yellow stripes repeated above the head. We can see that the dual staff appears from the deep bottom, and it also shows that the Magus is a meaningful awake connection between deep pools and peaks.

#### **3\. The Winged Sun Disk**

On the top of the stick, we see Ur-uatschi, an Egyptian winged solar disk, possessing both Uracus snakes. The one on the right represents the goddess of exploiting Nekhebet of the higher Egypt; The one on the left is Buto twin, the lower protection goddess of Egypt. In the most common form, this symbol is often seen on the Devil card, which represents the darkest part of the creative power of “Magus Mercurius.” According to the legend, Egypt’s Horus Sun god took over the shape of the winged sun disk to win against Seth, God of Evil. So Thoth, the intellectual god, ordered that all temples need to display this sign as a way to protect against evil. The two serpents Uracus are the sun protection powers, also considered as a guardian amulet on many Pharoah’s foreheads.

#### **4\. Empowered Serpent Stick**

The Uracus snakes protect the sun here, becoming a pair of snakes that make up the caduceus symbol (the sign of two snakes wrapped in medicine) (the scepter of Hermes): the snake(male) of the life and the snake (female) of death. The story of the exiled man only tells the wicked snake of death, whereas the medical students of Asclepius fight for the symbol of their field-the snake of lives. However, they merge together and form a vertical lemniscate line (infinity symbol) in the center, expressing the endless exchange between this world and the afterlife.

#### **3\. Fan Shaped**

While The Fool is in his madness to see through the obscurity of things, the Magus Thoth Tarot possessed a strong thicken the mist of eternity through his actions.

**_Basic spheres (blue background)_**

They are Tarot colored symbols located on the witch’s desk in the ancient Tarot deck. They correspond to acts (plates), wills (chopsticks), emotions (glasses), and thinking (swords). On the other hand, they represent the witch’s four basic weapons equivalent to four elements (fire, water, gas, and earth). Time and space for Hermetic witch to integrate all triangular spectra in these symbols: the power of will and understanding, heart and body.

#### **2\. Arrows, parchment**

**_Willpower level (blue wallpaper)._**

The arrow (above the right hand) represents the desire for awareness or energy towards the new horizon. For the Sharman, the arrow shot in the air with the meaning of pleading: it was a message and an invitation to God to attend the ceremony. In contrast, parchment contains knowledge that has formed, experienced and documented.

#### **3\. Scepter, winged egg**

**_The level of existence and appearance (light purple wallpaper)_**

On the fingertips of his right hand, the naughty guy held a scepter of Uas, an ancient Egyptian symbol of belief and power. Meanwhile, a winged egg floated above his left hand, it is a symbol of the miraculous power of the clear sky, the fifth element, the quintessential quality.

#### **4\. Human Ape**

**_The degree of darkness (partially obscured by the Mercury sphere)._**
