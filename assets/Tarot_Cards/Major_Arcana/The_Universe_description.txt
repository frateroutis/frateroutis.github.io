## **I. Background of the Universe Thoth Tarot card**

### **1\. The Universe Thoth card**

In the center of the Universe Thoth card, we see a virgin God dancing with a snake in front of the background which is a paradise wheel that symbolizes the eternal coming and going, this image is just like a possible return of the sacred installation of creation. She is the Naked Goddess Eurynome that the Pelasgians say she danced with the Ophion snake right from the beginning and brought the egg to this world. Just as her dance constantly leads to new images that replace the image right in front of them and make it disappear, the whole life follows the continuous process of transformation.

The four angels at the four corners carry the opened vulva (female genitalia) of the universe – or Shiva’s Eye, when observing it from the perspective of the horizon – from where a new universe emerges, and it also ends with destruction again. The light shines on the snake which is equivalent to the eye that opens in the upper line of the circle. This last trump card shows us that the goal will have to end without being revived again.

### **2\. At the end (end and start)**

Because the end gives birth to the beginning, and the beginning will have to prepare for the precondition of the end, the Universe Thoth card is the purpose that was introduced by [**the Fool Thoth**]() as a mental arrangement. Let’s imagine the flower that has been used as an example for the Fool: through our spatial and temporal perspective, the seedlings and flowers that exist one after another, which means the flowers grow from the seedlings but mentally, they exist at the same time. In other words, how can the seedling know when and how it blooms if it does not carry within the “flower experience”?

About the seedling itself, it is absolutely not the beginning, but rather the fruit of the previous flower. In the same way, the “Fool” knew that the “Universe” lived inside him because it corresponded to the inner purpose, however, he still needed a time measure to depart from within himself on the way to the destination.

## **II. Analyze and describe the Universe Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Motif (Universe is dancing)**

#### **a. Virgin**

In the center of the Universe Thoth card, we see an erotic theme: the virgin Goddess (Eve) is reconciling with the sinful serpent in a dance. The road from the Fool was completed in her place to finally open a new path, and so the question of its meaning proved inappropriate. The meaning lies within it, in liberation from meaning because the path is the goal. This is the paradox of all beginnings, and it appears in this card with a virgin, who combines herself and the universe together in a dance. When we recognize the eye as a rule of the universe (in the upper right of the picture), we also see the snake crawling out of it (it can be said as an open view), and how a woman frees herself from the original sin by reconciling with the snake.

#### **b. Snake**

The serpent can also be seen as a symbol of life as well as death (the snake of heaven), in this card, it is not understood in its dark side. Crowley interpreted it as the child of Nut and Hadit – as we see – there is an implication of the dark nature of this creature. So, the snake is not the opposite of God but is the dark part of the Lord that we have separated to make God exist only with the good side for us. The problem is in repressing our evil because we are always looking for motivation for the good and refusing to believe that the more lights there are, the more darkness will be created. Only when we know that each bright side can represent only the true unity in its dark polar opposite, can we understand the message of the Universe Thoth Tarot.

#### **c. The dancing couple**

The Goddess and the snake represent the opposite of human experience. Through their dance, they stopped the separation between light and darkness to give birth to a new spiritual soul in it, and thus, returned to heaven. The return to the beginning has happened and the ultimate goal has been achieved: “You and the Father are one”. Crowley wrote: The image of the Universe in this sense, according to it, is a virgin. The control of the luminous force in her hand, both active and passive, each contains its bipolarity. Her partner is known as Heru-Ra-Ha of Atu XI.

#### **d. Center (stone circle)**

The center of the Universe Thoth card is surrounded by a circle made of stones. More precisely: one of the seventy-two circles constitutes a circle that describes the world’s space, galaxies, and stones, developing into a unified whole, all are on the way of their destination. The number of seventy-two is a one-fifth of the circle. At the same time, it also represents the accuracy because the fixed starry sky moves an extra degree after every seventy-two years, so each new era begins after 2160 years. For the Cabalists, seventy-two is the number of the divine name made up of seventy-two letters or appears in seventy-two forms. The entire chain is called Shemhamphorasch (Hebrew = “the name is correctly pronounced”)

#### **e. Inside the circle**

“At the center, a wheel of Light is starting the form of the Tree of Life,” Crowley wrote, “showing the ten major celestial bodies of the solar system. But this tree cannot be seen except those who have a completely pure heart”. Instead, we see an entangled noose or an abyss, the symbol of birth and destruction cannot be understood. Because what is born struggles for rotting, but at the same time with decay, what is born grows up, and that is bound to rotting: The continuous creation itself does not make things small to infinite levels, but rather to form new and growing forms of creation. It is constantly expanding, and opposing energy is everywhere, it recognizes itself in the eternal “Death and Born”. We call it the universe.

### **2\. Surrounding circumstances (other symbols)**

#### **a. The house of material**

In the middle of the lower part of the card, there is a construction drawing of the house of matter, described as an expression of the arrangement of creation and the structure given as the basis of each new discovery.

#### **b. Four sub-angel**

In the four corners of the Universe Thoth card, there are four existing sub angels surround the universe. In “the Hierophant”, we encounter them like veils of the principles of the old age that have been hardened into creeds. Now, they are filled with a new life. They are winged creatures that carry four sacred altars, which represent the presence of God.

### **3\. Note**

####   
**1\. Background of the Universe Thoth Tarot (work completed)** **God’s workplace**

The birth is made up of itself, it is time belongs to the trump card XX – the Universe Thoth Tarot. However, God is invisible, who controls time (the theory of Bigbang, Einstein’s theory of relativity), so that immortality sees its path in space and in the course of time, is saved for the ultimate help. It outlines the most abstract concept of the highest creative energy that operates in secret, the vibration of the soul based on emptiness, and creates a dream of eternity (time and space) in nothingness.

So, there is no beginning and no end. Just like the egg in its experience, every birth contains the...18916 bytes truncated...
