### **1\. Symbol of the Fool Thoth Tarot**

When looking at this card, we can see a monstrous green character wrapped by four spirals, divided into four circles (on the mental level). Different symbols can be seen on the colorful rainbow strips. The green Fool (Bacchus – the Roman God of wine, Dionysus – the god of the grape-harvest, April Fool) takes up all the space with the tips of his shoes pointing out. It shows he does not interact directly with the earth.

_**Bacchus – the Roman God of wine**_

At first glance, he seems to hold the sky with his arms outstretched and raised high (the four corners of the Fool Thoth Tarot card represent endless space). His lustful expression was exalted with a pair of horns on his head, and in the middle, there is a cone diamond rising and touching the top of the pyramid of light around him. His fierce gaze glides over the observer (we cannot see the Fool’s eyes because his vision shaft shifts to one side). He is holding an inverted chalice in his right hand and a burning pine cone with sparks forming an arc in his left hand.

A bunch of grapes falls on his left shoulder, below which are coins with astrological symbols pouring down like the rain. There is the shape of an uncanny flower between his thighs; and in the middle of a human figure, at the center of reproductive energy, the sun is exposing.

### **2\. The beginning of the Fool Thoth tarot**

The trump card 0, the Fool Thoth Tarot, symbolizes a new phase of life that is gradually emerging from the mist of the subconscious, entering the realm of plans waiting to be made. The Fool is just a seed foreseeing the image of a perfect flower living inside it because this corresponds to the goal of the creative arrangement within but still needs some time to let the finished product be sprouted. He not only appears at the beginning but also at the end of an old cycle of creation. We can see how the causes of the past reflect in the results of the future because they are already in the form of the future that can occur in the vibe of its karma. This is the same as the physical gene of the parent tree telling the subsidiary branch the way it will bloom someday.

## **II. Analyze and describe the Fool Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Character (crazy man)**

#### **a. Fool**

The Fool, the character that occupies the entire space, not standing on the ground but hanging in the air, is a symbol of the loss of goal or lack of direction. Incidentally, a path is always available at his feet, and the goal is the direction of unintended movement. The Fool Thoth Tarot represents the unintentional without a firm stance. So, he did not stand on the ground, but the sole of his shoe turned towards the observer as if saying: nothing is the goal!

#### **b. The stare**

His gaze that glides through everything is an expression of a state of not looking. In the curse of this look, the Fool is experiencing himself beyond all forms of space and time of thought. He becomes accustomed to his deep inner existence, which cannot be understood by words and carrying within it the possibilities that have not yet formed.

#### **c. The head**

He has horns on his head and a crystal pyramid of light in the middle of the horns. The horns symbolize the desire for a life without enlightenment. It is also the desire to find a connection with the universe that is expressed in the form of the crystal pyramid of light. However, the Fool Thoth Tarot could only express this desire through ego and he could only get the manna from heaven in nowhere or in a suspended state. The territory of the Gods, which goes beyond all visualizations and concepts, rises inside the pyramid behind him.

#### **d. The hand**

The inverted chalice (water) in his right hand and the fire in his left hand are symbols of alchemy. The alchemist’s highest goal is to transform the basic into something more advanced through the connection of things that seem completely opposed.

### **2\. Background (Elements)**

#### **a. Fire**

The scene is set up (incomplete) by the collision between water and fire. The fire surrounding the green character (the Fool Thoth Tarot) is bigger than life when it emerges from space. They focus on a radiant sun in the sexual center of the April Goddess.

#### **b. Water**

The water that flows from above descends on the lower boundary forming the Water of Life (the Nile river with the lotuses), from which original prototype instincts are crawling (crocodile). Only when the mind merges with the soul (the highest level of the Fool) will people no longer need physical partners. Now, he or she had directly participated in the original source with all its life, found in the gesture of undying love. The glowing rose from the deepest level (in the crocodile) symbolizes this.

### **3\. Foreground (Spiral shape)**

#### **a. The first spiral (a bunch of grapes)**

The first heart-shaped circle shows the desire for inclusion and to break all limits. The stem of the grape bunch reaches out that circle (around the Fool Thoth Tarot neck). This corresponds to the ecstasy (the grape symbolizing drunkenness) is flowing into eternity, and the desire is flowing into the cycles of development and decay in the context of immortality.

#### **b. The second spiral (pigeon, butterfly, two snakes wrapping around each other)**

The second circle represents a level in which our logical thinking is no longer valid. This area represents the cycle of life and death. In an old-fashioned way, a dove embodies the spirit of fertility and a vulture is a virgin mating with the east wind. Butterflies show the need for development (from pupae to butterflies). It symbolizes the immortal soul that leaves the body and then reincarnates. The snake-shaped stick, which is called caduceus, represents the power of rising, receding or appearing and then disappearing: the snakes of life and death in eternity. The Egyptian sun symbol lurks in the wings at the top of the stick.

#### **c. The third spiral (babies, flowers, sun)**

At this level, we can see two babies wrapped around each other creating a physical bridge on the whirlpool of eternity. This is equivalent to expressing eternity in time and space. Above them (between the legs of the Fool Thoth Tarot), there is an exotic flower with 3 maces, symbolizing the transfer of energy of existence (babies) to the creative realm of emergence (the sun in the middle of the card representing the genital organ of the Fool).

The sequence of babies/flowers/sun must correspond to what the esoteric called the desire to have the light of the universe or the divine. Physicists call it an electromagnetic vibration region while the psychoanalysis considers sexuality. This trio shows the desire to integrate with eternity, which corresponds to Cupid or kundalini energy in Yoga, leading to the conception of nature.

#### **d. The fourth spiral (crocodile, tiger)**

This circle represents the brilliant light on the boundary of appearance, where the collective images of the past dream about their future before entering the new era. It corresponds to the creative will that until then has not been intended.

The crocodile from the deepest level reflects original instincts or primitive circles of the brain. The tiger is a symbol of the animal nature of the Fool, which is a combination of the animal and the divine. The crocodile and the tiger are symbols of the primal forces that are at play in the Fool’s journey.
