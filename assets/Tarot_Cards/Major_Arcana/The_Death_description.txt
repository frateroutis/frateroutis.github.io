## **I. Background of Thoth Tarot Death card**

The Thoth Tarot Death card shows the dance of death, representing the eternal cycle of the principle of “dying and giving birth” in its mutual impact. We see a skeleton kneeling, holding a scythe to harvest all withered things falling through a cloth of fate. The separation of dead threads makes the bubbles rise out of the muddy dirt, where life is sprouting. It is climbing the threads of time as the shining fabric, constantly expanding into new shapes of time and space. It was the death that created them by stirring them up from the scum of the bottomless abyss. The instinctive movement of this eternity is symbolized by a poisoned scorpion that lurks between two dead flowers of the swamp (lotus and lily). Along with the snake, fish, and eagle, it is a symbol of rebirth.

The Germans knew that their Lord Odin could walk on the stars to reach the distant worlds that belonged to the next life if he changed the form before he did it. His body lay there as if sleeping in death. However, he himself turned into a wild bird or a wild animal (here, it corresponds to the danger of the scorpion), a fish or a snake. According to Crowley, Thoth Tarot Death card illustrates the association of rotting, fermentation of the alchemy process, that – as well as humus – is a prerequisite and a basis for a new life or a new impetus for development.

## **II. Analyze and describe Thoth Tarot Death**

### **1\. Motif (Death)**

#### **a. The principle of death**

The humanization principle of Death is portrayed as an endless series of transformations into a new life. According to Crowley, this card itself represents the dance of death: “This picture is a skeleton carrying a scythe, and both the bones and the scythes are prominent Saturn symbols. This may seem strange because Saturn has no clear connection to Scorpion, but Saturn represents the basic structure of existing things”.

#### **b. Skeletons and scythes**

Primarily during the Middle Ages (not just during that period), the Death was identified with Saturn and skeletons because it was only regarded as a destroyer, and thus, is the archenemy of mankind. The soul can be immortal, but the form to connect it to this life is our body, and that is exactly the form that death destroys. Life and death, before and even now, are not considered to be parallel but are seen as victims of each other. However, because the scythe is in the hands of the dead hanging on the threads of life itself, we realize that it is the cycle of death and rebirth. On another level, the scythe is a crescent moon, corresponding to Hecate – a Greek god of death, miracles, and magic.

#### **c. Hemet (crown of Osiris)**

Saturn as a reaper reflects our fear of death. However, we should not equate it with actual death. The helmet on the head of the skeleton is the crown named Atef of Osiris, an Egyptian God of the afterlife. He, the husband of Isis, became a victim of his brother’s lie, Seth. Seth tore him into fourteen pieces (there are many sources that claim to have twenty-seven pieces). However, the God Anubis collected all the pieces, and Isis awakened her beloved husband to a new life.

From this beginning, Osiris became the master of the domain of death in the west and was the guardian of the water of life, expressed in the ancient Egyptian Bible: May Osiris someday give me the water fresh. We see the same thing in legal traditions. The preacher tells of the journey into the world below, where they face demons within them who literally tear their flesh from the bones. After symbolic death is always a rebirth, and following the cutting of flesh is a miraculous advance to enter a new body.

### **2\. Circulation**

#### **a. Dance of Death**

Death is the dominant factor in the cycle of “growth and decline”, connecting the continuous shapes of creativity together. Because we often only look at each thing without seeing the threads connecting them, our misunderstanding of death is serious. People only find inner tranquility when overcoming the fear of a fact that cannot change that everything must have an end, otherwise, there will be no beginning.

From there, he will no longer resist the installation of nature because the old life creates humus so that a new life can be born. This layer of humus corresponds to the mud of the soul that the Death stirred up, because, with his scythe, the Death created bubbles in which the shapes began to be created by him with his dance. The dance of Death expresses the connection of death that always contains births related to those deaths. In this way, the fruit that is ripe within us for life is death. When people understand this, death is no longer a contradiction to life, but rather a counterbalance to birth.

#### **b. The rebirth**

So, birth represents the other pole of the cycle of “death and rebirth”. This is expressed in figures of people dancing in bubbles. Through his appearance, Thoth Tarot Death seemed to open a door and allowed a glance inside a wave. All life is based on the background of absent-minded death because all new things are formed on the transient of the old. When we refuse to accept this fact, we are resisting the consistency of creation in the image of Death.

#### **c. C.G. Jung**

I have just completed a series of observations about people with spiritual lives that I can follow until death is near. The approaching ending is often represented by symbols that are also signaled by changes in psychological state in ordinary life, which are symbols of rebirth (…). I have the ability to repeatedly monitor the signs of oncoming death close to the time of return to a year, even in cases where the external situation does not allow for those thoughts. So, death was set long before it actually happened. I was amazed to see that the unconscious mind did not care much about death. Accordingly, death is probably not an important issue. The subconscious seems to be concerned only with how people die, which means whether the attitude of the subconscious to death is harmonious or not.

### **3\. Three levels of development**

#### **a. The lowest territory (scorpion, the flowers of the swamp)**

The scorpion is crawling on rotting plants in dangerous mud, which is an unhealthy source of energy that creates decay. At the same time, the fermentation process heats up the “dead and born” principle because its work corresponds to the production of soil from the residue of decay. On this lowest level of the Thoth Tarot Death card, we see it as a gravedigger buried that into the ground and thus, created new humus. However, not death against life, but the self always delineates the boundaries for death by not letting the energy sources flow away but accumulating as protection from fear of death. Therefore, Thanatos – the instinct of death, is not the desire to die, but the reaction to the blocked life that is seeking its way out of the act of destruction. Crowley writes:

The scorpion symbolizes rotting in its lowest form. The stress of the environment has become too much to bear, and the element of attack has voluntarily obeyed the change, and so, the element of potassium thrown on the water began to ignite and accept the cover of hydroxyl sprout.

#### **b. The medium level (snake, fish)**

The snake and the fish mean double water that represents the symbols of the subconscious. That snake is the snake of death and life, the fish is both a manifestation of the power of giving and preserving the life of the water and the monste...7176 bytes truncated...
