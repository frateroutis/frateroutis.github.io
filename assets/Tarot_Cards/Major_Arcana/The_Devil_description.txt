## **I. Background of the Devil Thoth Tarot card**

The principle of darkness (creative energy in its most material form) is drawn at the center of the Devil Tarot card is a mountain goat (Hymalaya’s goat) with a pair of powerful horns. It symbolizes Bannebdjet of Mendes’ Egyptian God, which the Greeks considered Pan, the son of Hermes, the lustful plant God. His facial expression exuded an insidious expression because he was the embodiment of darkness, of dark instincts and even unknown things, also the key to open unused spaces in the human soul. You only know instinct, you never know anything else.

There is an intense power operating is the ultimate darkness of creation, dangerous but necessary for life. It is also symbolized by a scepter with winged sticks and Uranus snakes (the ancient Greek symbol for the King), its hilt crashed through to the roots. There is an Egyptian symbol of the winged sun hidden between bird wings on the tip of a stick. It corresponds to the light in the dark (the big third eye on the forehead of Pan God) appears intentionally from the deep bottom: “For pure will, the unremitting purpose stems from the desire to achieve results is perfect in every way. ”(Crowley“ Liber Al vel Legis ”42-4).

## **II. Analyze and describe the Devil Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Theme (Male Goat)**

#### **a. Opponent of God**

The Devil Thoth Tarot shows the dark side of God, the soul that creates the world, hidden or confined in the matter, represented by a black crow or a male goat with horns. When God is understood in the double sense, both a loving father in paradise and a God of hatred and punishment, there is no need for the Devil with its present meaning. Therefore, he is hardly mentioned in the Old Testament, and if it is mentioned, he is just an exiled angel, but never a true rival of God. It just stops at the level of God’s image associated with one-sided good, and the Devil is the crystallization of all evil.

As Jung pointed out, the division of four parts of a whole is the four most dominant, in which the fourth position makes the whole, but by nature, it is always understood in a double way. Because except for those three traditional paradises, the fourth position was occupied by Mary’s devotion that spread during the Middle Ages, so it could only be understood in a double sense. But because Mary becoming a pure and unblemished goddess in heaven, it is necessary to create an absolutely opposite image in the world: It is overconfidence in the Devil Thoth, the unknown character for up to that point, along with all its extremes in hunting witches.

#### **b. The scapegoat (sublimation)**

In the past, every culture thought that aggression should not be suppressed but respected. It needs to be given space so its blind violence is limited and at the same time, directed towards more positive paths. Ancient atonement rituals and mystical worship systems created channels that led to the transformation and sublimation of the prototype energy of Dionysus and Asasel, the goat God of the Middle East, the scapegoat. If something belongs to God is denied or suppressed, the Devil Thoth Tarot will occupy it and carry out cruel tendencies in activities such as the Appeal of the Sabbath (Black Mass), burning the victims who are considered witches, bloody Inquisition, the Crusade. (Edward C. Whitmont).

#### **c. Collective darkness**

In the West, the Devil was first created from separation and struggle in Christianity. The collective darkness was attributed to the Devil in the Middle Ages. To resist its temptation, we can only rely on pure faith. The true relationship with the Devil is left to the mystical figures and alchemists, who are more objective when confronting the darkness. Hermes or Hermes Psychopompos (the character who accompanies spirits from this world into the next world in Greek mythology) is regarded as the escort of sinful spirits because he moves in the realm of darkness with aching pain and uncovered cunning. He is the soul that created the world, a soul that is hidden or imprisoned in the material.

In the rosary of alchemy, Hermes speaks of himself: “I bring light (Lucifer = who brings light), but darkness belongs to my nature.” Pan, in turn, is the horn of the son of Hermes, and he had a mischievous face because he knew that the Devil was expressing his nature under the shadow of light. In the Devil Thoth Tarot, we see everything that this world does not like to look straight at it.

#### **d. To be initiated (the third eye)**

The devil has to smile due to this because he realizes that people do not see themselves creating reality and then fighting with it. Following the Gnostic trend in religious thought, the Devil Thoth Tarot is often respected as a true friend and God of humanity, in contrast to the Christian God who is erratic and lacks intolerance, the man who ordered the sacrifice of his own son to reconcile with mankind, even though he had immense power. However, one can sympathize with these images, none of which can deceive us with the idea that this world does not exist evil, no matter what we call it.

We must learn to not only see the Devil in others but also to understand that there are fundamentals within us. We humans are dark magicians, not exactly noticing that fighting our shadow (fighting evil) only leads to collapse and destruction. In contrast, Devil’s third eye on the forehead reflects the wise and conclusive awareness that has been mulled over the self within the patterns of consciousness and behavior of a person.

#### **e. Horned (horns)**

Contrary to the unicorn, the Christian symbol corresponds to a five-pointed star with a tip pointing up, and thus, it represents the sacred symbol of unity (a sharp tip), the horns of a male goat symbolizes the pentagram in the opposite state with one lower end and two sharp tips pointing upwards (which were painted in the Rider deck like a reversed pentacle between Devil’s horns), indicating polarity and sin, and becomes a symbol of dark magic. Crowley suddenly announced advice to the British government that they should oppose the German swastika with effective measures by using the sign of victory that Winston Churchill spread.

#### **g. Crown (lotus crown)**

The lotus crown between the horns reminds of the Egyptian God Nefertem – “absolutely a perfect person.” He is the God of light and also the God of death. In Egypt, the lotus – the flower that carries the sun within it, is thought to have originated in the original waters, and at the same time, symbolizes the creation of the world from wet areas, and its scent is said to be able to rejuvenate oneself. The flowers, which bloom when the sun rises and closes at night, are related to the God of sun and the development of light from the mud of the primitive age. However, in Egyptian mythology, the lotus crown is the sign through which Isis realizes that Anubis, the child abandoned by his mother, Nephthys, is the son of Osiris. The lotus crown, therefore, confirms that the wearer is the son of good (evil is part of the good).

### **2\. Tree of Life (statue of the penis)**
