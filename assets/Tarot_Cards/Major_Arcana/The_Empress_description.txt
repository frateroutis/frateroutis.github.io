## **I. The Background of The Empress Thoth Tarot**

When you look at the Empress Thoth Tarot, it is a picture of a woman in a crown sitting on the throne, the center points are implied by the zigzag green flames. The observer noticed the body with a twisted posture: chest and arms were facing forward, while her face and lower body tilted to the left side, compared to her strong upper body (mother’s strength), part round buttocks (sensuality) and lotus flowers are blooming (prosperous) in her right hand.

**Crowley has written:**

> Her right hand held Isis’s lotus flower which is symbolized femininity or passive energy. Its roots lie in the soil beneath the water or right in the water, as the petals bloom under the sun. Parked on the fire shaped pillars of the throne are her two most sacred birds – sparrows and doves. It is a carpet embroidered with fish and mixed flowers below the throne. Her coat has two faces: on the one hand, the pelican figure is feeding her children with the blood of her heart; the other side is a white eagle of the Alchemist.

The two-headed eagle is the alchemy symbol of transformation and rebirth, which describes creative cycles. It emphasizes the inner mind of the Empress, all of the lives have its origin from the mother’s source “and creates its appearance (birth) when all of its prerequisites are fulfilled.

The pelicans are feeding their children with their own blood, is the symbol of the mother’s devotion and endless love, even if this symbol is explained easily: to find food for their children, the pelican bent down deeply till its beak touched its chest. Because fish blood is usually still on the beak, its fur is tinged with red, giving the impression that it is taking its blood to the children.

## **II. Analyze and describe the Empress Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. Shape (Druidess)**

#### 

**The Empress Thoth Tarot**


In this card, the appearing of Empress seems to be through the perspective of men, described in terms of the masculine experience along with the eternal feminine rather than the symbol of endless power through which nature constantly creates new life. The light pale color of this card contains elements of “pure whiteness”, and is also the idealized masculine image of the mother. However, the Empress Thoth Tarot is actually the symbol of the Great Goddess, the mother of the elemental authority of all life. She is a symbol of creative formation, through which thought has not yet become a material mother.

#### 

**Appearance (the sparrow)**


The sparrow on her right is associated with Aphrodite and is Aphrodite’s sex desire for expression. The Empress turned away from the sparrow to the dove. We see the awkwardness of Crowley’s mother Goddess, who refuses to acknowledge her instinct. It is shown in the lower body that is rotating away from the erotic value of the upper body. (Crowley sees the alchemist symbol sketched in the bust of the Empress).

#### 

**The glance (dove)**


A glance at a dove perched on top of the pillar expresses the intellectual inheritance of [**The Priestess**]() or the harmony of femininity with gods (the ideal image mother of Christianity is a virgin), because the Holy Spirit  conceives for Mary in the form of a dove (see p. 45 on the dove symbol).

#### 

**Hands (the lotus)**


The Empress Thoth Tarot was holding a lotus leafstalk that looked like a penis symbol, representing the masculine reproductive energy in her right hand, her left hand gently opened as cuddling an invisible child.

#### **The outfit  (the White bee)**

Bees are dancing in a circle (a symbol of the queen in the beehive) on a pink shirt. The character is surrounded by blue water pillars, created from the flash of The Magus in the ocean of High Priestess.

#### 

**The expression of those images (entire picture)**


The character in the Empress Thoth Tarot has not flowered and entered life. Her face was neither imprinted with passion nor radiant because of her instincts. All hints about pleasure are expressed with pure solemnity: she appears more like a saint than a woman. This card traditionally represents devotion and passion. It is a higher intention to “expose” the ancient femininity of lower instincts on the altar of infinite love, or the answer finds in the image of a couple of women and Crowley’s mother, allows him to ignore your lower instincts (sexuality). Naturally, the Empress is also the symbol of the dark mother demanding a life that he is afraid of.

### **2\. Surrounding (the others symbol)**

#### 

**The pelican, eagle**


The love of Mother is represented by a red-pink pelican feeding her blood (see “context”), in the Egyptian calendar, which represents the harvest season. However, the two-headed eagle is a symbol of collaboration (in alchemy, it is a symbol of male mercury), entered into a gradually rising moon sign.

#### 

**The neck, Crown**


The neck reveals the portrait of the Empress to the world, representing the eternal birth. This is also reflected in her crown where the world was born between the crescent and full moon.

#### 

**The moon, lily**


The crescent moon on the right and the full moon on the left symbolize the eternal cycle of growth and decay. According to that meaning, the trumpets at the bottom of the card reflect the two feminine poles (from a man’s perspective); Lilies are a beautiful image and widely known as the purity, innocence, and virginity. However, if it is a Japanese orchid, it adorns the grasslands of the hellish world of Greece, the valley of Japanese orchids. It is for Persephone, the dark side of Great Mother. Another legend says that Aphrodite really hates lilies because of its harmlessness and purity. Hence, she coldly gave it a picture that reminded the donkey’s penis.

## **II. Interpretation of the Empress Thoth Tarot**

### **1\. The context (the realm of lives)**

The Empress represents sexuality in its charming image chain; she was Eve after being exiled, in contrast to her sacred equivalent of High Priestess. We find ourselves in the material realm, Mother Nature or the source of food, or warmth (full moon). This is a time of gentle combination, gentle attention, and great transformation. However, it was also a time of possessive affection (the baby grew up in her mother’s womb), and in the light as well as in the harmonious world that this painting conveyed to us, the shadows had advanced from below.

### **2\. Overview of the Empress Thoth Tarot**

We recognize a Great Goddess in the Empress Thoth Tarot, representing the source of lives. She is the endless power of nature that constantly brings a new life, and is an inexhaustible spring that encourages our creative potential and ability to accept impulses, allowing a new thing to inside development. She also symbolizes the need in order to destroy the structures of the old life, create a new one, break the taboos, and raise herself to learn the mysteries of life as well. However, she can also lead to the insanity that destroys unconsciously.

### **3\. Awareness**

Everything implies that nature combines immortality in the cycle of death and birth. Humans cannot avoid that cycle somehow. Nothing can help them not to go through the development era, peaks and crises, bursting and dying. It is a natural process that is part of life. The Empress Thoth Tarot reminds us that we are all part of this cycle, and that we should embrace it rather than resist it. She also encourages us to be open to new experiences and to allow ourselves to grow and evolve. The Empress is a symbol of fertility, abundance, and creativity. She reminds us that we have the power to create our own reality and to manifest our desires. She also encourages us to be nurturing and compassionate, both to ourselves and to others.
